/**
 * Audio-only mode for bilibili live: the official web player has no
 * audio-only toggle (only the mobile app does), so we stand one up
 * ourselves.
 *
 * Strategy — true audio-only via the app-side `only_audio=1` stream:
 *
 * 1. **CSS hide** of `#live-player video` flips synchronously the moment
 *    the user toggles, so the player frame goes blank instantly while we
 *    spin up the audio pipeline in the background.
 *
 * 2. **Native player teardown** via `livePlayer.stopPlayback()`. Bandwidth
 *    measurements during validation showed `pause()` keeps the buffer
 *    fed (~2.4 segment requests / second) but `stopPlayback()` drops
 *    bandwidth to ~0.1 requests / second — i.e. truly halts the live
 *    HLS pull. `reload()` brings it back when the user toggles off, with
 *    the user's previously-selected quality preserved (no quality switch
 *    needed; restoring the native player is enough).
 *
 * 3. **Audio-only FLV stream** fetched via the Android app endpoint
 *    `xlive/app-room/v2/index/getRoomPlayInfo?only_audio=1`. We verified
 *    empirically that the returned FLV contains only audio tags (FLV
 *    type 8, AAC) and zero video tags — the JSON response still echoes
 *    a `video_codecs` field but the bytes on the wire really are audio
 *    only, ~180 kbps vs ~1700 kbps for the original 1080P stream
 *    (~10× bandwidth saving). The web endpoint ignores `only_audio=1`
 *    so we have to use the app endpoint.
 *
 * 4. **Playback via mpegts.js** (a maintained fork of flv.js), which
 *    demuxes the FLV container and feeds AAC frames into a hidden
 *    `<audio>` element's MediaSource buffer. The library is **lazy-
 *    loaded** from the unpkg CDN on first toggle (~120 KB, cached after)
 *    so users who never use audio-only pay zero load cost.
 *
 * 5. **Volume / mute** captured from the native player BEFORE
 *    `stopPlayback()` (which nulls out `getPlayerInfo()` on its way out)
 *    and re-applied to the hidden audio element across stream-refresh
 *    re-attaches, so the user's volume preference survives the handoff.
 *
 * 6. **Stream URL refresh** every ~50 minutes. Bilibili signs CDN URLs
 *    with a ~1 hour expiry; we refresh before that window closes so a
 *    long listening session doesn't get a silent disconnect.
 *
 * 7. **Watchdog** re-calls `stopPlayback()` on a 1.5 s tick whenever the
 *    `<video>` element's src reverts to a `blob:` URL — that's the
 *    unmistakable "somebody re-engaged the player" signal. The known
 *    offender is BLTH's `SwitchLiveStreamQuality` module, which auto-
 *    restores the user's preferred quality on page load; without the
 *    watchdog the user would end up streaming both the native 1080P
 *    video AND our audio-only stream simultaneously.
 *
 * 8. **Graceful fallback**: any failure on enable (mpegts CDN down, API
 *    error, autoplay block, etc.) tears down half-built state, reloads
 *    the native player, and surfaces the error via `appendLog` — so the
 *    worst case is "feature didn't take, native player keeps playing"
 *    rather than a silent broken state.
 *
 * The toggle button itself lives in `components/audio-only-button.tsx`,
 * rendered as a sibling of `弹幕助手` in the bottom-right corner of the
 * page. We previously tried injecting it into bilibili's own player
 * controls (cloning the 小窗模式 tip-wrap), but `stopPlayback()`
 * destroys that whole subtree — and other userscripts in the wild stomp
 * on it too — so the Preact-rendered, outside-the-player approach is
 * simpler and more compatible.
