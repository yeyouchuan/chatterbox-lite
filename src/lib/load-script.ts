/**
 * Shared lazy `<script>` loader for CDN-hosted UMD bundles.
 *
 * Shared lazy loader for CDN-hosted UMD bundles. It probes the page for a
 * global, injects a `<script>` tag if missing, shares the in-flight promise
 * for concurrent callers, and evicts the cache on error so a retry can
 * re-fetch.
 *
 * Why we deliberately bypass the bundler's `externalGlobals` /
 * Tampermonkey `@require` path for these libs: that path fetches
 * eagerly at every userscript injection, even on pages where the
 * feature is never used. Lazy injection collapses that cost to zero
 * until the user actually toggles the feature on.
 *
 * The injected `<script>` runs in the page context (not the
 * userscript sandbox), so the global lands on the real page window.
 * Callers must therefore probe via `unsafeWindow` rather than the
 * sandboxed `window` the userscript sees by default.

/**
 * Inject `url` as a `<script>` tag and resolve once `getGlobal()`
 * reports the expected global is on the window. Safe to call
 * concurrently — callers for the same URL share a single fetch.
 *
 * @param url - Script URL (typically a version-pinned unpkg path).
 * @param getGlobal - Probe that returns the installed global, or
 *   `null` if it isn't on the window yet. Called BEFORE injection
 *   to short-circuit when something else on the page already loaded
 *   the same library, and AFTER `onload` to confirm the install
 *   actually took (script `onload` only proves the bytes downloaded,
 *   not that they did anything useful — a 200-with-empty-body would
 *   silently "succeed" otherwise).
